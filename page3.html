        <p>The purpose of this assignment was to formulate thoughts based off movie called "Freedom Writers" which portrayed high school students in the gang life. These students went to Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, California.</p>

        <p>The reason I chose this assignment was not because it was based off a movie but it contained the goals and passions that I strive for today. In other words we had to formulate our essay around the ideas that the movie portrayed which were economic hardships and family poverty as a "what if" situation. In this essay I reflected upon my personal struggles that I am currently trying to overcome and will do as time progresses forward.</p>

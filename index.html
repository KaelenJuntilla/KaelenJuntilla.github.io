    <p>The anticipation of wanting to discover more of something is hidden in what is called "experience". As a person of curiostiy, I believe there is no limit to how much one can experience even if that experiece is short-lived. My name is Kaelen Juntilla and I will be sharing with you my interests from my perspective. I enjoy running but only if it is with other people as running alone is never any fun. I like to enjoy watching sports like football and basketball. Along with that medicine is something I also love to partake in. I want to be able to utilize medicine to bring opportunities to others that have a disiblity or are suffering from medical disparities.</p>
